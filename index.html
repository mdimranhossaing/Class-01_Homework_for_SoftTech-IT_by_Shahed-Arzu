    <h1 style="text-align: center;">THE SEASON I LIKE BEST</h1>
    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong>There are six seasons in Bangladesh.I like all the seasons but I like spring most.
    Spring is my favourite season and perhaps it is favourite to all.Spring comes to us with many pleasant things and
    beautiful scenes and sounds.</p>
    <p><strong>Why I like it:</strong>I like this season for many reasons.The summer is a season of terrible heat.Everybody
    feels uneasy.During the rainy season the roads become muddy.There is water everywhere.People can not move easily.
    They face many difficulties.During the early autumn and late autumn these disadvantages do not wholly disappear.The
    winter also brings troubles.People shiver in cold.There is dense fog everywhere.The sun is hardly seen.The poor 
    suffer a lot.But spring has none of these disadvantages.It has many attractive scenes and pleasant things.So I like
    the season most.</p>
    <p><strong>Its arrival and duration:</strong> After winter the spring season comes with her lovely appearance.Spring is
    called the queen of seasons.It comes with pleasant sights and sounds.Fields and meadows become green.Flowers bloom 
    in different trees.Birds sing from behind the new leaves.We hear cuckoo singing sweetly.There are village fairs on 
    various occasion.During spring bees are busy in gathering honey.A gentle breeze blows.Everything looks gay and 
    cheerful.It is also a season of fruits. Mango,black berry,jack fruit,lichies have buds on them.Farmers also sow the
    seeds of jute and paddy.</p>
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>Spring is the best of all seasons for its attractive sounds and sights.Our poets have 
    praised this season.</p>
